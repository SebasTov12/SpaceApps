# 🌍 AirBytes — AI-powered Air Quality Forecasting Assistant

**AirBytes** is a prototype built for the **NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
It predicts **near-future air quality (PM2.5, AQ index)** by combining **satellite data (TROPOMI, TEMPO\*)**, **ground stations (OpenAQ)**, and **meteorological data (OpenWeather)**.  
The system provides **personalized advice** through a **chat assistant** interface, empowering communities to take informed health and lifestyle decisions.

> \*TEMPO covers North America; for Bogotá (our pilot city) we use **TROPOMI Sentinel-5P** and ground stations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Hybrid AI forecasting**: merges satellite, ground, and weather data.
- **Chat assistant**: ask in natural language (“How is the air today in Bogotá?”) and get predictions + health tips.
- **Explainable predictions**: every forecast shows confidence and reasoning.
- **Personalized advice**: health-oriented recommendations (e.g., outdoor activity safety, mask use).
- **Scalable architecture**: easily extend to other cities/regions with available data.

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SebasTov12/SpaceApps.git
   cd airbytes-hack
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Add API keys:

   ```bash
   export OPENWEATHER_API=your_openweather_key
   ```

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

## 📊 Data sources

* **Satellite**:

  * [TROPOMI Sentinel-5P (NO₂, O₃, CO, etc.)](https://s5phub.copernicus.eu)
  * [TEMPO (North America only)](https://tempo.si.edu/)
* **Ground monitoring**: [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)
* **Meteorology**: [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* **Sample dataset**: included in `/data` for Bogotá demo.

---

## 🧠 Model

* **Random Forest Regressor** (scikit-learn) trained on historical PM2.5 + weather + satellite features.
* If no model is provided, the system falls back to a **naïve persistence heuristic** (scaled current PM2.5).
* Output: predicted PM2.5 (µg/m³), simplified AQ index (1–5), and confidence score.

---

## 🖥️ Architecture

* **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS (chat interface + info panel).
* **Backend**: Flask API (Python).
* **Model**: scikit-learn (RandomForest, extendable to XGBoost/NN).
* **Deployment**: local demo (can be extended to cloud / container).

---

## 📅 Roadmap

* ✅ Build MVP (Bogotá demo)
* 🔄 Add real-time OpenAQ + TROPOMI integration
* 🔄 Expand to more cities & multi-language support
* 🔄 Deploy to cloud (Heroku / GCP / AWS)
* 🔄 Enhance ML (spatio-temporal models, ensemble learning)

---

## 🎥 Demo

1. Open the app (`python app.py`).
2. Ask the chat assistant:

   * *“How is the air today in Bogotá?”*
   * *“Can I go running?”*
3. The assistant replies with predictions + health advice.
